# fELLowship 

For our CS 228 (HCI) final project, we designed a React based webpage to help ELLs in the US. In middle and high school, English language learners (ELLs, formerly ESLs) are oftentimes isolated (culturally, linguistically, and oftentimes physically) from their native English speaking peers; they need a way to communicate and connect with their native English-speaking peers in order to speak English outside of the classroom and connect with the larger school (and local) community. fELLowship, is just that.

## Implementation

fELLowship is a React app utilizing Ant Design components. More about Ant Design can be found on their website https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce. For navigation, we used React Router. More on React Router can be found at https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start. 

## To run the webpage locally

1. navigate into the fellowship folder from the terminal
1. install dependency installers (npm and yarn)
    1. install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    1. once Node.js is installed, run `npm install --global yarn`
1. install dependencies
    1. run `npm install react-router-dom@6 history@5`
    1. `yarn add antd`
    1. `npm install --save @ant-design/icons`
1. to start the React app locally run `npm start`
